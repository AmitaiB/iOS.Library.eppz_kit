 Return with the string representation of the given color.
 
 @discussion
 [UIColor whiteColor] converts to @"[1.000000, 1.000000, 1.000000, 1.000000]".

/*!
 
 Returns a UIColor instance configured with the given string representation.
 
 @discussion
 If the string is given in a components format, function returns [UIColor whiteColor] for "[1, 1, 1, 1]".
 Alternatively you can reconstruct colors from class factory method names.
 Function returns [UIColor whiteColor] for both "whiteColor" and "white".
